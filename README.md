# Dungeonbot
Discord bot built for Dungeons and Dragons 2024 Edition, with functions for players and dungeon masters to use. Made with the intent of organizing play, and providing newer players a helpful guide to understand the rules.

If you want to run this bot yourself, be sure to run all the scripts for the parts you want ot use before running the main.py file.
